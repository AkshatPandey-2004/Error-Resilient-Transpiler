# Error-Resilient Python to Java Transpiler

## Overview

The **Error-Resilient Python to Java Transpiler** is a tool that automates the conversion of Python code to Java while identifying and correcting common errors. It scans Python code line by line, detects mistakes, and applies predefined correction strategies to generate Java code. The transpiler can handle syntax errors like missing semicolons, incorrect function names, and indentation issues. It also generates an error log documenting each correction, making the process transparent.

This tool simplifies Python-to-Java conversion for developers, providing them with Java code that adheres to correct syntax while saving valuable debugging time.
